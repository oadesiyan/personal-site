                        <p id="bio-text">Hello everyone, I'm Oluwapelumi and I am a rising senior at New York University [NYU] studying <span class="special-text">computer science with a minor in lingustics</span>.
                            I'm was raised in Maryland, specifically the D.C. Metro area, but since starting college, I've spent most of my time in NYC.
                            I was originally drawn to computer science back in high school when the dual enrollment program I was in had a criminal justice track and a cybersecurity track.
                            While in the criminal justice track, I realized that it may not be something I wanted to do longterm, and I decided to pursue computer science in college.
                            Throughout my time in college, I've come to see how applicable computer science is to different industries, and I see how I can make the major my own.
                            I've tried out minors in Business of Media & Technology [a discipline that combines media studies, business, and technology], journalism,
                            and linguistics. Ultimately, linguistics stuck, but throughout college I've used my extracurricular activities to explore my interests.
                            <br> <br>
                            I enjoy web development, and I've spent the summer trying to learn tools and skills such as React and Figma that can better help me exercise
                            the creative aspect of web development.
                            <br> <br>
                            Currently, I am completing a data analytics <span class="special-text">externship with Beats by Dr. Dre</span>. My hope after college is to 
                            work as a software engineer at a media company, but after my internship at Schr√∂dinger last summer which introduced me to SQL, I have also
                            been considering working as a data analyst.</p>
